Hola todos del mundo,

This week the challenge was to import a third-party React library into my blog. Unlike last week, I felt this was more in my ballpark having previous played around with React and JSX. The challenge suggested Formik, a cool library for building forms. I was quite open to learning this new little library as learning all this new Gatsby stuff, even though it's based on React, is quite foreign. This week, I seeked some familiarity.

Those of you familiar with React will possibly find this task easier than last week so if you wish to add a little challenge I'd recommend implementing a backend, or a psuedo-backend. Something that processes off your Gatsby site. Yes, this will require set up of third-party features or your own architecture (server build enthusiasts).

## Hello, _Formik_

To get started, work through [Formik's in browser tutorial](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/tutorial). It's pretty straight forward so long as you are familiar with the prerequisites: "familiarity with HTML, CSS, modern JavaScript, and React (and React Hooks)". But not everyone is as I soon discover. No fret.

Love their tagline: "Build forms in React, without the tears".
