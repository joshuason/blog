        I'm just a regular guy who likes to tinker with things that tickle my
        curiously creative curiosities. <br />
        When I'm not coding I doodle. On occasions, I have been known to
        obsessively overindulge in a cheesburger or two. <br /> <br />

        This blog documents the progress of my Gatsby learning process‚Äì‚Äìlearning
        new things like Markdown, Gatsby's API, plugins, and deployment. Just
        like the self-taught learning process at times, this blog is unrefined
        and unprocessed. I draw sustanance from various other blogs, essays and
        online documentation. I hope you enjoy reading my struggles unfiltered
        and that you gain something of value.
