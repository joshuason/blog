import SignupForm from "../../components/SignupForm"

Hello people who've made it thus far,

I have accomplished this weeks taskâ€“behold! A React component embeded within MD!

<SignupForm />

Our sign up form *(after much difficulty)*. In hindsight it was easy as pie. Only took a few days extra.

## Moving to MDX

Anyone familiar with React knows that JSX is the bread and butter to the library. MDX is the love child of JSX and MD ðŸ¤±
