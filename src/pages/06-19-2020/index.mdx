import SignupForm from "../../components/SignupForm"

Hello fortunate people,

I have accomplished this weeks taskâ€“â€“behold, a React component embeded within MD:

<SignupForm />

Our sign up form *(after much difficulty)*. In hindsight it was easy as pie. Only took a few days extra.

## Moving to MDX

Anyone familiar with React knows that JSX is the bread and butter to the library. MDX is the love child of JSX and MD ðŸ¤±
