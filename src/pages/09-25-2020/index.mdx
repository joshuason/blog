So I discovered this week that I don't wanna do SEO. Again, ideally things would be built baked in .

It was pretty easy to implement so hopefully my site scores 100 on Lighthouse for SEO.

So first off, I created an SEO component, meshing the examples on [GitHub](https://github.com/marisamorby/marisamorby.com/blob/master/packages/gatsby-theme-blog-sanity/src/components/seo.js) and a [GatsbyJS article](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/add-seo-component/). When added, this component essentially adds a Helmet component to each page, injecting it with relevant metadata to drive up its rank in SEO.

Nextly, I created a structured data snippet to include into my Helmet/SEO component. I didn't know what the hell structured data was but Gatsby explains it nicely. It seems to me like a JSON formatted (it's actually JSON-LD) data that uses specific name tags like "@context" and "@type". This syntax reminds of the data within the Gatsby developer environment, in the package\*.json filesâ€“â€“but I digress. I wrap that juicy data in a <span class="code">&lt;script&gt;</span> tag and finally include it within my component. And hopefully, fingers crossed, it works.
