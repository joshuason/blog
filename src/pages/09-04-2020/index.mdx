Call me naïve but why do I need offline support for my blog website? Like literally no-one is going to download it to their home screens so why do I need to complete this seemingly redundant objective?

I’ve been entertaining this thought throughout the week of this challenge but I guess it’s just another skill to add to my arsenal. Although this task was basically to read two/three docs about PWA’s and install gatsby plugins manifest and offline. Then the usual listing them in the gatsby-config file, stating manifest prior to offline.

Kinda goes to say, this task went on without a hitch.
