## Challenges:

- initial filter function didn't do what I wanted
- new ESLint warnings
- github pages threw shade

## Victories:

- added a filter function to filter tags
- pushed to github
- used gatsby build
- published site to various CDNs (surge.sh, netlify, github pages)
- ran my first lighthouse audit

### Conclusions

##### / key takeaways

- Bask in the glory of those achievements of firsts
- Google is your bff
- I think I'm going to stick to pushing to surge.sh due to it's usability/ease of use, speed and reliability.
