This week I had a few achievements but I will discuss three topics: filtering, CDNs and Lighthouse auditing.

### Filtering

As my blog accumulates more posts, it'd be useful to filter by topics (ie tags). Also I thought it'd be nice to add in a functional trait to my blog to provide some interaction to the very little interaction presently available on my blog. Filtering seems pretty straightforward right? Just adjust the callback method within the .filter() function––and presto!

1. Add tags to markdown frontmatter v
2. Create a state to track which tags are active v
3. Create a custom component (optional) v
4. Add onClick event to component v
5. Implement handleClick function to toggle state v
6. Create callback method for .filter() v

### CDNs

### Lighthouse

## Conclusions:

- Bask in the glory of those achievements of firsts.
- Google is your bff.
- Github pages is dumb. Either that or it's me. (JK it's most likely me and I need to do some further looking into git/github).
